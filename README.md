Identifying Suspicious Browser Extensions
Suspicious extensions can compromise your privacy, steal data, or inject malware. Here's how to spot them:

Check the Source and Permissions: Legitimate extensions come from official stores (e.g., Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons). Review the developer's website, user reviews, and ratings. Be wary of extensions requesting excessive permissions like access to all websites, browsing history, or downloads—unnecessary for their stated purpose.

Look for Red Flags: Extensions with vague descriptions, poor grammar, or promises of "free" features that seem too good (e.g., unlimited VPNs or ad blockers) are often scams. Check for recent updates or complaints on forums like Reddit or security sites (e.g., Malwarebytes forums).

Monitor Browser Behavior: If your browser slows down, shows unexpected ads/pop-ups, redirects pages, or tracks you unusually, an extension might be at fault. Use built-in tools like Chrome's Task Manager (Shift+Esc) to see resource usage.

Scan with Tools: Run antivirus software (e.g., Malwarebytes, Bitdefender) or browser-specific scanners to detect malicious extensions. Cross-check against lists from sites like VirusTotal or the browser's extension manager.

Verify Installation Date and Usage: If you don't remember installing it or it's from an unknown source, it's suspicious. Extensions bundled with software downloads are common vectors.

Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions
Once identified, remove them promptly. Steps vary by browser; here's a guide for popular ones. Restart your browser after removal for full effect.

Google Chrome
Open Chrome and click the three-dot menu (top-right) > More tools > Extensions.
Find the suspicious extension, toggle it off, then click Remove.
Confirm removal. If it's malware, reset Chrome: Settings > Advanced > Reset and clean up > Restore settings to their original defaults.
Mozilla Firefox
Click the menu button (three lines, top-right) > Add-ons and themes.
Go to Extensions, select the suspicious one, and click Remove.
For thorough cleanup, go to Troubleshooting Information (about:support) > Refresh Firefox.
Microsoft Edge
Click the three-dot menu > Extensions.
Find the extension, click Manage > Remove.
If needed, reset Edge: Settings > Reset settings > Restore settings to their default values.
Safari (macOS)
Open Safari > Preferences > Extensions.
Select the extension and click Uninstall.
Clear cache: Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data > Remove All.
General Tips
Backup Data: Before removal, export bookmarks or settings if needed.
Prevent Reinstallation: Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading from untrusted sites. Enable browser warnings for extensions.
Update and Secure: Keep your browser updated, use a reputable antivirus, and consider extensions like uBlock Origin for ad blocking instead of risky ones.
If Infected: If removal fails or issues persist, run a full system scan or seek help from support forums.
